The data contains all events of each Olympic game and the medal results, i.e., which countries won a bronze, silver, or gold medal for each event. This data was harvested from the official [Olympics website](https://olympics.com/). For each Olympic games in the dataset, it is broken down by event, categories within the event (by gender), and the medal won by the athlete or team, and their associated country. For this project, the dataset will be trimmed down to focus exclusively on the weightlifting events from 1896-2020 (the most recent summer games in the dataset).\n",
